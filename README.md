# Feature Engineering for chemical compound prediction

I was given data obtained by chemists at UoS and was asked to do something with it.

It was a first year undergrad competition, probably my first project more closely related to data science. I don't remember where I placed but I took part in a `ggplot2` course with its creator as a reward. Fun!
